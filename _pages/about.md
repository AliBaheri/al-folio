I am currently in the first year of my PhD in Economics at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/phd/phd+in+economics+and+finance/phd+students/copia+di+current+phd+students+in+economics+_+finance_acquati+2011+09+30+11+21">Bocconi University</a>, Milan, Italy.

I obtained my Bachelor and Master in Economics from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/">University of Mannheim</a>, Germany. I am planning to do empirical research on current social issues like education, health, poverty, or wellbeing.
